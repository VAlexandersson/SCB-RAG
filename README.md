# RAG Demonstration

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the performance of large language models by enabling them to retrieve and use relevant information from domain-specific datasets. By incorporating targeted data, RAG not only improves the accuracy and usefulness of the language model's outputs but also streamlines the user's interaction with the data. For example, a RAG-enhanced model could retrieve product specifications from a database to provide more detailed and accurate responses to customer inquiries, making it easier for users to find the information they need.
